Node.js Express Backend For Task Manager
Welcome to the Node.js Express backend for our project. This README provides an overview of the backend setup, features, and usage instructions.


Overview
This backend is built using Node.js and Express, providing a robust and scalable foundation for handling server-side operations. It includes various endpoints for handling user authentication, data retrieval, and more.


Setup
To set up the Node.js Express backend, follow these steps:

Installation: Ensure Node.js is installed on your environment. You can install Node.js by visiting the official Node.js website and following the installation instructions.

Dependencies: After installing Node.js, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

npm install

Configuration: Configure the necessary environment variables and settings as per the project requirements.

Start the Server: Once the setup is complete, start the Express server by running the following command:

npm run dev or node server.js

API Endpoints: The backend provides the following API endpoints:

/login: Handles user authentication and generates a session token upon successful login.
/register: Manages user registration and account creation.

/tasks:
GET: Retrieves tasks data.
PUT: Updates existing tasks.
POST: Creates new tasks.
DELETE: Deletes tasks.


Usage

To interact with the backend API, use the provided endpoints based on the project requirements. Ensure proper authentication and authorization for secure access to the API resources.


The backend utilizes several dependencies to enhance its functionality and security. Here's an overview of each dependency and its role:


bcryptjs (^2.4.3):
This package provides password hashing functionality, ensuring that user passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the database. It helps protect user credentials from unauthorized access and potential security breaches.

cors (^2.8.5):
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a crucial security feature that allows the backend to handle requests from different origins. This package enables the backend to manage cross-origin requests securely, enhancing the overall security of the application.

express (^4.18.2):
Express is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building robust web applications and APIs. The backend utilizes Express to handle routing, middleware, and HTTP requests effectively.

express-validator (^7.0.1):
This package provides a set of robust and flexible validation and sanitization functionalities for incoming requests. It ensures that the data received by the backend meets specific criteria, enhancing the overall data integrity and security of the application.

jsonwebtoken (^9.0.2):
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for secure transmission of information between parties. This package facilitates the creation, verification, and decoding of JWTs, enabling secure authentication and authorization processes within the backend.

nodemon (^3.0.3):
Nodemon is a utility that monitors changes in the backend's source code and automatically restarts the server when changes are detected. It enhances the development workflow by eliminating the need to manually restart the server after code modifications.

pg (^8.11.3):
The pg package is the PostgreSQL client for Node.js. It enables the backend to interact with a PostgreSQL database, facilitating efficient data storage, retrieval, and management operations.
